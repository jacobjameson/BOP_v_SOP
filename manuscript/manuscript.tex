\ABSTRACT{We use practice variation across physicians to uncover the
role of test-ordering on care delivery in the ED. Using records of over
45,000 Mayo Clinic emergency department visits, we find that
quasi-random assignment to a top (versus bottom) decile batching
physician significantly increases excess diagnostic testing.
Instrumental variable results show that batching leads to an additional
13.5 tests per 100 batches, resulting in excess tests that would not
have been ordered under a sequential-ordering strategy. Contrary to
expectations, batch ordering does not reduce ED length of stay or affect
72-hour return rates, challenging the perceived efficiency of batching
and highlighting the necessity for more targeted testing strategies in
emergency care.}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:I}}

Healthcare delivery, particularly in the emergency department (ED), is a
delicate balance that involves ensuring optimal patient outcomes while
optimizing resource utilization. Achieving these twin goals requires
timely and accurate diagnosis, which in turn enables prompt and
appropriate treatment, consequently improving patient prognosis and
reducing the likelihood of adverse events. Furthermore, efficient
patient discharge from the ED can help alleviate overcrowding, a severe
issue with potential consequences including higher complication rates
and increased mortality \citet{bernstein2009}.

One important factor that can impact the speed and effectiveness of
diagnosis in the ED is the availability and performance of diagnostic
tests \citet{naseim2015}. A variety of diagnostic tests are used in the
ED, including laboratory tests, imaging studies, and specialized tests
such as electrocardiograms (ECGs) and point-of-care (POC) testing. These
tests can provide valuable information about a patient's condition and
help to guide treatment decisions.

A critical question in this context pertains to whether physicians in
the ED should batch order diagnostic tests or order them sequentially.
This decision essentially represents a tradeoff between reducing patient
length of stay and risk of over-testing. Over-testing, or performing
unnecessary tests, can lead to increased costs, unnecessary patient
anxiety, and potential harm from follow-up of false-positive results
\citet{koch2018}. Conversely, keeping a patient for an extended time to
perform all possible tests could lead to ED overcrowding, an issue
associated with severe consequences, as mentioned earlier. Instead, what
is needed is a reasonable balance between the number of diagnostic tests
performed and the total time the patient is kept in the ED before either
being admitted or discharged. Several studies have demonstrated that
optimizing the ED patient flow process can result in significant
improvements \citet{saghafian2015}, however, research surrounding test
ordering strategies to improve the patient flow processes remains
limited.

In this paper, we use data from over 45,000 patient visits to the ED
that occur during our study period to quantify the benefits and
consequences of batching versus sequentially ordering diagnostic tests
on patient length of stay, re-admission, and resource utilization. Our
empirical strategy exploits random assignment of patients to ED
physicians who differ in their propensity to batch-order diagnostic
tests. When patients arrive at the ED, they are assigned to a physician
based on availability, with no discretion on either side. Thus, patients
who arrive at the ED at similar times are randomly assigned to
physicians who vary in their willingness to batch order diagnostic
tests. We measure physician tendency to batch using a leave-out,
residualized measure based on all other patients the physician has seen
in the ED in the study period. The tendency measure strongly predicts
the ED test batch outcome but is uncorrelated with patient and ED visit
characteristics.

We start by evaluating the reduced-form effects of ED provider
batch-ordering tendency on downstream patient outcomes and turnaround
time. We find that practice variation as captured by physician
batch-ordering tendency has large and significant consequences. Being
treated by a provider in the top decile of the tendency distribution,
compared to being treated by someone in the bottom decile {[}INSERT
RESULTS{]}.

Because of the institutional features of the ED, our research design
closely approximates an RCT that assigns patients to batch-ordering or
sequential-ordering arm. In the ED, patients have no discretion over
choosing providers, and in our specific ED, physicians have discretion
over choosing patients, alleviating major selection issues present in
other health care settings. Furthermore, physicians exhibit wide
variation in practice behavior in batch-ordering, even within the same
hospital, while following the same guidelines. Finally,
patient-physician interactions in the ED are typically well documented,
short, and one-off, constraining physician decision-making to a more
limited, better-observed choice set than present in settings such as
specialty or primary care.

In sum, exploiting practice variation in ED settings shuts down other
(but not all) potential channels besides test batching that are present
in other settings, determine length of stay, and impact patient
outcomes. This approach allows us to move closer to identifying the
causal impact of batch-ordering diagnostic tests on patient outcomes and
resource utilization. It is important to note that this paper studies
the impact of batch-ordering through a batching decision requiring
clinical judgment (within practice norms) rather than through specific
hospital policies, differences in adherence to clinical practice
guidelines, or substandard care.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. The next section
describes the data source and outlines our baseline sample. The
empirical strategy and its accompanying identifying assumptions are laid
out in Section III. Section IV presents the results. Section V draws
implications for batch-ordering policies. The last section concludes.

\section{Data and Definitions}\label{sec:II}}

Our analytical lens is focused on the Emergency Department at the Mayo
Clinic of Arizona, a distinguished tertiary care establishment. During
the timeframe of our study, the ED recorded an annual visitation of
approximately 45,000 patients. The department is singularly staffed by
board-eligible or board-certified emergency physicians, abstaining from
the services of nurse practitioners or physician assistants. A notable
observation was that residents in rotation oversaw a low fraction,
roughly 10\%, of the patient volume. Comprehensive patient data,
encompassing demographics, chief complaints, vital signs, emergency
severity, length of stay, and resource utilization metrics, were
meticulously logged during the study period.

\hypertarget{sample-construction}{%
\subsection{Sample Construction}\label{sample-construction}}

Our research design focuses on adults who visit the Mayo Clinic of
Arizona ED. We observe approximately \(48,000\) such visits until during
the study period. To improve power, we drop encounters with rare chief
complaints (\(<1000\) total encounters of this kind) and complaints
where a batch order occurs less than \(10\) percent of the time. Since
batch orders are rare for these cases, our physician batch tendency
instrument could suffer from a weak instrument problem if we included
them. Examples of complaints dropped include urinary complaints and
allergic reactions. Excluding these conditions does not introduce
selection bias unless physician test batching tendency is orthogonal to
physician diagnosing behavior. While this assumption may be violated if
we were to use a very detailed level of chief complaint information upon
which to base our exclusion criterion, it is plausibly satisfied when
using broad complaint
categories\footnote{The idea being that, for a patient who presents with an ankle fracture, different physicians may choose different detailed diagnosis codes within the three-digit ICD-9 824 (``Fracture of ankle"), but are unlikely to disagree at the broader chief complaint category (``Extremetiy Complaint").}.
In order to estimate a precise measure of physician-level batch
tendency, we further restrict our sample to the \(42,000\) encounters
involving physicians who treat over 500 ED cases per year.

\hypertarget{variable-definitions}{%
\subsection{Variable Definitions}\label{variable-definitions}}

Our explanatory variable in the IV analysis, \(Batched_i\), is an
indicator for whether patient \(i\) has their tests batch-ordered at
their ED encounter. While the patient could decide not to undergo the
tests ordered by the physician, this is rare in practice, where we
observe that approximately 97(?) percent of all tests ordered are
conducted. Below, we detail our primary outcomes: (a) ED length of stay
(LOS), (b) resource utilization, and (c) 72-hour return.

\emph{(a) ED length of stay (LOS).}-- ED-LOS is a critical measure of
efficiency and patient throughput in emergency care settings. It is
defined as the duration from a patient's arrival to the ED until their
departure, whether by discharge or admission to the hospital. Although
the literature provides a range for long ED-LOS, we operationalize long
ED-LOS as stays exceeding the 75th percentile in our dataset for this
study. This approach allows us to contextualize the definition of
extended stays according to the specific demographics and case mix of
the ED under study.

\emph{(b) Resource Utilization}-- Resource utilization in the ED
typically refers to the extent of medical services and interventions a
patient receives. In this study, we quantify resource utilization by the
total number of diagnostic tests ordered per patient during their ED
stay. This encompasses both initial and subsequent tests. The hypothesis
is that batch testing may lead to variations in the number of tests
ordered, potentially influencing the overall healthcare expenditure and
efficiency.

\emph{(c) 72-hour return}-- The rate of patients returning to the ED
within 72 hours of their initial visit is a proxy for the quality of
care received. A high 72-hour return rate might indicate inadequate
treatment or diagnostic oversight during the initial visit. We measure
this outcome as the proportion of patients with a subsequent ED visit
within 72 hours post-initial discharge.

\hypertarget{batching}{%
\subsubsection{Batching}\label{batching}}

In the context of our study, batching in diagnostic test ordering is
defined as placing multiple test orders for a single patient within a
5-minute interval. To ensure the robustness of our analysis, sensitivity
tests were conducted on this cutoff point, affirming that our results
are consistent and reliable, irrespective of minor variations in the
batching definition.

Our study identifies and differentiates between two distinct strategies
of batching:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Lab + Image Batch: This category of batch order includes instances
  where a patient's batched diagnostic tests comprise a combination of
  at least one imaging test (such as a contrasted CT scan,
  non-contrasted CT scan, X-ray, or ultrasound) and one laboratory test.
  This mix is fascinating as it suggests a comprehensive diagnostic
  approach, possibly catering to complex medical cases.
\item
  Image + Image Batch: This category encompasses batch orders where a
  patient's diagnostic tests consist of two or more distinct imaging
  tests. The reliance solely on imaging in these batches may indicate
  specific diagnostic pathways or a focus on conditions that primarily
  require visual diagnostic methods.
\end{itemize}

It is important to note the differing implications of these batching
strategies. While lab tests often can be processed concurrently with
imaging tests, causing minimal additional waiting time, a batch of
multiple imaging tests requires the patient's presence for each test,
potentially leading to significant increases in waiting time. Thus, the
composition of a batch order can provide valuable insights into the
physician's decision-making process, particularly in balancing between
patient waiting times and diagnostic uncertainty. This balance can be
especially crucial in the context of varying complexity levels of
patient encounters.

Figure 1 illustrates the occurrence rates of each batching type across
the top ten most frequently reported chief complaints, providing a
visual representation of how batching practices vary with different
patient presentations.

\hypertarget{summary-statistics}{%
\subsection{Summary Statistics}\label{summary-statistics}}

\hyperref[tab:summary_statistics]{Table 1} presents a detailed overview
of the emergency department (ED) characteristics, patient demographics,
and medical tests for our baseline sample, derived from the data
collected during the study period. On average, the emergency department
manages a volume of approximately 24 patients (Mean = 24.18), indicating
a significant but manageable patient load. Key physiological markers
such as tachycardia (Mean = 0.19) and tachypnea (Mean = 0.09) are
prevalent among patients, albeit at varying degrees, highlighting
critical aspects of emergency care. Notably, a small proportion of
patients exhibit febrile (Mean = 0.02) and hypotensive (Mean = 0.01)
conditions, emphasizing the diversity of cases encountered in the ED
setting. The Emergency Severity Index (ESI) averages at 2.78, suggesting
that most cases fall within the moderate acuity level.

Common chief complaints in the emergency department paint a vivid
picture of patient needs and healthcare demands. The data reveals
abdominal complaints (Mean = 0.14), extremity complaints (Mean = 0.12),
and chest pain (Mean = 0.08) as the most frequently occurring, followed
by neurological (Mean = 0.08) and gastrointestinal issues (Mean = 0.08).
This information is crucial in understanding the primary reasons for ED
visits and the required resources for patient care.

The patient characteristics in our sample depict a diverse demographic
landscape. The average arrival age in the ED is approximately 58 years
(Mean = 58.33), indicating a predominantly middle-aged population. The
racial composition is predominantly White (Mean = 0.89), with smaller
proportions of Black (Mean = 0.04) and Asian (Mean = 0.03) patients.
Notably, a slight majority of the patients are female (Mean = 0.54),
offering insights into gender dynamics in healthcare utilization.

In terms of diagnostic tests, the data reveals a high reliance on lab
tests (Mean = 0.77), indicating their crucial role in patient diagnosis
and management. X-Ray (Mean = 0.47) and CT scans, both non-contrast
(Mean = 0.21) and contrast (Mean = 0.19), are also frequently employed,
underscoring the importance of imaging in modern emergency medicine.
Ultrasound usage (Mean = 0.11) and the practice of batch ordering tests
(Mean = 0.38) further reflect the operational aspects of the ED and the
strategies employed to manage patient care effectively.

\section{Empirical Strategy}\label{sec:3}}

Our empirical strategy closely follows the literature that relies on
quasi-random assignment of agents to cases, often referred to as the
``judges design.'' Papers in this literature typically exploit variation
in the sentencing leniency of judges who work in the same court.
Similarly, we explore batching variation across physicians who work in
the same emergency department. In its reduced form, under the assumption
of quasi-random assignment, this approach allows researchers to identify
the causal effect of being assigned to different types of physicians.
Under additional assumptions, an instrumental variable approach
identifies the causal effect of a given medical decision. We employ both
approaches and lay out their details in the next subsections.

\hypertarget{institutional-details-on-patient-physician-assignment}{%
\subsection{Institutional Details on Patient-Physician
Assignment}\label{institutional-details-on-patient-physician-assignment}}

Contrary to most healthcare settings where patients exhibit choice, they
are predominantly passive in their physician assignment in the ED. In
most EDs, however, physicians have discretion in picking their patients.
In contrast, patients arriving at the Mayo Clinic ED are randomly
assigned to physicians via a rotational patient assignment algorithm
\citet{traub2016emergency}, which removes potential selection bias
concerns for our analyses. In essence, barring arrival time and
shift-level variation, the physician-to-patient matching can be deemed
random. Table \ref{tab:wald_test} displays that patient encounters
(regarding chief complaints and emergency severity) are equitably
distributed across physicians within our study's cohort.

\end{tablenotes}
\end{table}

\hypertarget{batch-tendency-construction}{%
\subsection{Batch Tendency
Construction}\label{batch-tendency-construction}}

To measure physician batch tendency, we use the physician's residualized
leave-out average batch rate. This measure is derived from two steps
following the approaches taken by \citet{doyle2015measuring},
\citet{dobbie2018effects}, and \citet{eichmeyer2022pathways}. First, we
obtain residuals from a regression model, which includes all ED
encounters in our sample period.

\begin{equation}
Batched_{i,t} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_{ym} + \alpha_{dt} + \alpha_{complaint} + \varepsilon_{i,t}
\end{equation}

Where \(Batched_{i,t}\) is a dummy variable equal to one if patient
\(i\) had their diagnostic tests batched on encounter that took place on
date \(t\). Fixed effects include year-month fixed effects,
\(\alpha_{ym}\), to control for time and seasonal variation in batching,
such as hospital-specific policies (e.g.~initiatives to eliminate excess
testing) or seasonality in ED visits. We also control for
``shift-level'' variations that include both physician scheduling and
patient arrival with day of week-time of day fixed effects,
\(\alpha_{dt}\). Chief complaint by severity fixed effects,
\(\alpha_{complaint}\), were also included to increase precision. As
stated earlier, these controls are what is required for our quasi-random
assignment assumption. Under the assumption that we have captured the
observables under which quasi-random assignment occurs in the ED, the
unexplained variation-- the physician's contribution-- resides in the
error term, \(\varepsilon_{i,t}\).

In step two, the leniency measure for patient \(i\) seen by physician
\(j\) is computed as the average residual across all other patients seen
by the physician that year:

\begin{equation}
Tendency_{i,j}^{phys} =
\frac{1}{N_{-i,j}} \sum_{i' \in \{J \backslash i\}}\hat{\varepsilon}_{i'}
\end{equation}

where \(\hat{\varepsilon}_{i'} = \hat{Batch}_{i'} - Batch_{i'}\) is the
residual from equation (1); \(J\) is the set of all ED encounters
treated by physician \(j\); and \(N_{-i,j} = |\{J \backslash i\}|\), the
number of cases that physician has seen that year, excluding patient
\(i\). This leave-out mean eliminates the mechanical bias that stems
from patient \(i\)'s own case entering into the instrument. The measure
is interpreted as the average (leave-out) batch rate of patient \(i\)'s
physician, relative to other physicians in that hospital-year-month,
hospital-day of week-time of day.

We document that the Mayo Clinic ED physicians exhibit wide, systematic
variation in their propensity to batch order diagnostic tests. Figure
\ref{fig:physician_batching} graphs the histogram of batch-ordering
frequency by physician for popular chief complaints, highlighting that
the variation in batching differs systematically.
\hyperref[tab:regression]{Table 3} presents the ``first stage'' in a
regression table: being assigned to a \(10\)pp higher batch-tendency
physician is associated with a \(8\)pp increase in the likelihood of
having tests batch-ordered in the ED. The F-statistic is 50 when all
controls and fixed effects are included. The coefficient is greater than
one because all emergency visits are used to construct the leniency
instrument, while the first stage is calculated using the baseline
sample only, which excludes the rare complaints.

The quartile of batchers is calculated based on the batching rate across all complaint areas per physician.

Batched_i = \delta_0 + \delta_1 Tendency_{i,j}^{phys} + \delta_2 X_i + \nu_i
\end{equation}

Where \(Y_i\) represents our main outcomes of interest: length of stay,
72 hour readmission, and resource utilization. and \(X_i\) is the same
as in the reduced-form approach. \(Batched_i\) variable suffers from
potential endogeneity concerns. For example, injury severity may be
unobserved and correlated with need to run multiple tests, which in turn
also affects length of stay. Hence, we instrument \(Batched_i\) with the
assigned physician \(j\)'s underlying tendency to batch,
\(Tendency_{i,j}^{phys}\). We cluster robust standard errors at the
physician level to account for the assignment process of patients to
physicians.

\hypertarget{identifying-assumptions}{%
\subsection{Identifying Assumptions}\label{identifying-assumptions}}

The reduced-form approach delivers an unbiased estimate of the causal
effect of being treated by a higher tendency to batch physician, since
assignment of patients to ED physicians is random, conditional on
seasonality and shift (``conditional independence''). The
residualization in equation (1) controls for more controls than required
to achieve quasi-random assignment; they are included for statistical
precision in measuring physician tendency to batch.

Our instrumental variable approach, which aims to recover the causal
effect of having diagnostic tests batch ordered, relies on three
additional assumptions: relevance, exclusion, and monotonicity. We
reported a strong first stage (i.e., relevance) at the end of the
previous Section. The exclusion restriction requires that the instrument
must influence the outcome of interest only through its effect on test
batching. This is perhaps our strongest assumption and is at its core,
untestable. However, several features of the ED setting suggest that
such violation may likely only have a small impact and may be less
concerning than in other health care settings. First, unlike in primary
care settings, where the patient and primary care provider have many
repeat encounters, the scope of what the emergency physician can do to
impact medium-term outcomes is limited and well-observed by the
researcher. Second, any violation of the exclusion restriction needs to
directly affect the specific outcome of interest. The channel by which
ED physicians can influence length of stay relative outcomes is likely
through testing and diagnosis. Nevertheless, we take this assumption
seriously and perform a placebo check in Section 4.2 as well as various
robustness checks in Section 4.4.

Finally, the monotonicity assumption is necessary for interpreting the
coefficient estimates obtained from the IV approach as Local Average
Treatment Effects (LATEs) if there are heterogeneous treatment effects.
It requires that any patient who is (not) batched by a sequencer
(batcher) would also (not) be batched by a batcher (sequencer)
physician. The literature leveraging the judges design typically
performs two informal tests for its implications. The first one provides
that the first stage should be weakly positive for all subsamples
(\citet{dobbie2018effects}). The second implication asserts that the
instrument constructed by leaving out a particular subsample has
predictive power over that same left-out subsample
(\citet{bhuller2020incarceration}). Appendix Table {[}\ldots{]} presents
both of these tests in the two columns for various subsamples of
interest. Finally, we check whether our main results hold using
differential, mutually exclusive leniency measures (i.e., by complaint
category) in Section 4.4.

\subsection{Reduced-Form Results}\label{reduced-form-results}}

In this section, we explore the causal influence of physician batch
tendency on patient outcomes and resource utilization in the emergency
department. Our reduced form regression results, as presented in Model 1
of Table \ref{tab:reducedform}, reveal that batch tendency correlates
with prolonged ED length of stay (LOS), increased test ordering, and
does not materially alter the likelihood of a 72-hour return. Notably,
these associations are nuanced by an underlying factor: the physician's
testing inclination.

\end{table}

We construct a physician's testing inclination using the same method
used to measure physician batch tendency, but instead we use the
physician's residualized leave-out average test rate to get a measure of
a physicians propensity to test. A key consideration in our analysis is
the strong positive correlation (\(r = 0.79\)) between batch tendency
and testing inclination. Such a high degree of correlation raises the
concern that physicians with a higher testing inclination may batch more
often as a result of ordering more tests. Failure to control for this
inclination could result in biased estimates of the effect of batch
tendency.

The introduction of a Directed Acyclic Graph (Figure \ref{fig:DAG})
elucidates the interconnected pathways between batch tendency, batch
ordering, and primary outcomes. We posit that while batch tendency
directly influences the practice of batch ordering tests, batch tendency
and batch ordering are concurrently influenced by testing inclination.
This is critical as testing inclination has a direct effect on primary
outcomes, necessitating its inclusion as a control variable to
disentangle its confounding effects.

\end{tablenotes}  
\end{figure}

In Model 2 of Table \ref{tab:reducedform}, we control for testing
inclination and observe notable changes in the coefficients for batch
tendency. The previously significant positive association with ln(LOS)
diminishes, suggesting that the initial estimate may have been capturing
the combined effects of batching and testing inclination. Estimated
coefficients for batch tendency are scaled by the difference in batch
tendency going from the ninetieth to tenth percentile in physician batch
tendency for interpretability, and coefficients for testing inclination
are scaled by the difference in testing inclination going from the
ninetieth to tenth percentile in physician testing inclination---equal
to 34.9 pp.

Assignment to a physician in the top batching decile (relative to one in
the bottom decile) is associated with a 0.2 unit increase in the number
of diagnostic tests being ordered per patient encounter, without any
additional change in the likelihood of a 72-hour return. With an average
of 1,805 patient encounters per physician in our study period, this
translates to an additional 361 diagnostic tests with no perceived
benefit in terms of reducing returns or length of stay.

The effects of testing inclination are also striking. We find that a
movement from a physician in the top testing decile (relative to one in
the bottom decile) is associated with 0.6\% change in the length of stay
in the emergency department, a 0.96 unit increase in the number of
diagnostic tests being ordered per patient encounter, and -0.03 pp
change in the probability of a patient returning within 72 hours. Given
the average number of patient encounters per physician in our study
period this translates to an additional {[}\ldots{]} patient hours in
LOS, {[}\ldots{]} diagnostic tests, and {[}\ldots{]} avoided 72-hour
returns.

\hypertarget{placebo-check}{%
\subsection{Placebo Check}\label{placebo-check}}

In this section we investigate whether the reduced-form effects observed
in Section 4.1 are due to differences in batch rates across providers or
due to other provider differences correlated with batch tendency. We
start by studying reduced-form effects among patients with complaints
that are never batched, as a ``placebo/falsification check.'' By way of
example, consider a patient who arrives at the ED with a urinary tact
infection---a condition for which patients rarely undergo imaging
testing. For such patients, we should expect to see no impact of batch
tendency only if high batching and low batching physicians do not
systematically differ in other dimensions of care relevant to patient
outcomes. Conversely, if we do find a reduced-form effect for these
patients, then high batch tendency physicians must systematically differ
from low batch tendency physicians in other dimensions of care, beyond
batching.

To that end, we restrict attention to ED visits for complaints where
batching occurs no more than 10 percent of the time (recall that our
baseline sample only includes complaints with a \textgreater10 percent
batching rate). We estimate a reduced-form regression of each main
outcome on physician prescribing leniency for the subsample, following
equation (3). The results of this exercise are displayed in Table
\ref{tab:placebo_check}. They show that in contrast to results for our
main sample, the association between physician tendency to batch and a
given outcome is statistically indistinguishable from zero and much
smaller in magnitude for the samples of patients who visit the ED with
health conditions that are rarely batched.

\emph{ED length of stay (LOS).}-- Our analysis reveals that batch
ordering does not significantly reduce the length of stay in the ED.
This finding holds even after accounting for various control variables,
including ED volume and patient acuity. Contrary to common assumptions
that batching tests could expedite patient throughput, our results
suggest that the efficiency gains could be offset. A possible
explanation lies in excess tests being ordered due to batching, which
could lead to increased wait times for patients. This is consistent with
our finding that batching increases the number of tests ordered.

\emph{Resource Utilization.}-- The impact of batching on resource
utilization is pronounced. We observe a 0.135 increase in the number of
tests ordered due to batching, corresponding to approximately 2,206
additional tests during our study period. This is likely due to the
information gain that occurs from sequential test ordering, where a
physician may order additional tests after receiving the results of the
first test.

\emph{72-hour Return}-- Our findings indicate that batch ordering does
not significantly impact the likelihood of a 72-hour return. This
suggests that despite the increased number of tests, there is no
corresponding decrease in short-term readmission rates. This highlights
the need for more targeted testing strategies that balance comprehensive
assessment with resource efficiency.

The instrumental variable analysis presented here underscores the
complexities underlying batch ordering practices in the ED. While
batching is often seen by physicians as a method to enhance efficiency,
our findings suggest that it may lead to increased resource utilization
without corresponding gains in patient throughput or reductions in
short-term return rates. These insights point to the need for a more
nuanced approach to test ordering in emergency care, one that carefully
weighs the benefits of comprehensive assessment against the risks and
costs of potential over-testing.

\hypertarget{investigating-mechanisms-excess-testing}{%
\subsection{Investigating Mechanisms: Excess
Testing}\label{investigating-mechanisms-excess-testing}}

In the context of our study's findings, particularly the pronounced
impact of batching on resource utilization, it is essential to condense
and ground our discussion in the observed data. We reported a
significant increase of 0.135 in the number of tests ordered due to
batching, translating to roughly 13.5 excess tests per 100 batch orders.
Here, an `excess test' is defined as one that likely would not have been
ordered if the physician had chosen sequential test ordering. This
suggests that the information gain from sequential testing, where the
need for additional tests is informed by the results of earlier tests,
could lead to more efficient and targeted use of diagnostic resources.

To further understand this phenomenon, we probe into high-volume
complaint areas in the ED. By focusing on these areas, we can discern
which specific complaints are more likely to lead to excess testing
under a batch ordering system. This analysis is crucial as it sheds
light on the causal effect of batching in different clinical scenarios.

For instance, let's consider complaints like chest pain, abdominal pain,
and shortness of breath -- common high-volume areas in the ED. In cases
of chest pain, batch ordering might lead to simultaneous orders for
ECGs, blood tests, and imaging, potentially resulting in unnecessary
tests if the initial ECG provides clear diagnostic information. In
contrast, a sequential approach could have deferred or eliminated the
need for some of these tests based on initial findings.

Similarly, in patients presenting with abdominal pain, batched orders
for a combination of imaging and laboratory tests might be common.
However, if initial lab results indicate a clear diagnosis, further
imaging may not be necessary, highlighting the potential for excess
testing through batching.

Analyzing these high-volume complaint areas allows us to identify
patterns in testing practices and their implications. It becomes evident
that batch ordering, while perhaps intended to expedite diagnosis, may
inadvertently lead to the over-utilization of tests. This not only has
implications for resource utilization but also for patient experience
and overall ED efficiency.

In conclusion, our investigation into the mechanisms behind excess
testing due to batching reveals a nuanced picture. While batching might
seem efficient at a glance, the lack of information gain compared to
sequential testing leads to a significant increase in the number of
tests ordered, particularly in high-volume complaint areas. This insight
is vital for formulating more effective testing strategies in emergency
care, highlighting the need for careful consideration of when to employ
batching versus sequential testing approaches.

The 2SLS results presented in the previous sections are robust to
several alternative specifications probing the key identifying
assumptions of independence, exclusion, and monotonicity. We describe

overview here \ldots.

Across all robustness checks and main outcomes, we find magnitudes of
our estimates broadly unchanged.
